[#abstract]
== Abstract

This proposes an RFC (request for change) process to create and change the
primary "Programming Languages Tools Standard" publication. The process is
intended to facilitate evaluation and evolution of changes in a maximally open
method, so that all stakeholders and the community can collaborate towards
the widest consensus.

[#motivation]
== Motivation

A driving force of the EcoStd group is to provide tooling standards that are
widely adopted and of high utility for everyone. As such involvement from the
varied tooling community is key. This proposal aims to make it easy for that
community to define the tooling standards.

[#scope]
== Scope

This RFC process' primary aim is to specify how to change the tooling standards
of EcoStd. But it is expected to also be applied to any decision that is
sufficiently impactful to this community. Possible impactful decisions could
include:

* New features to the tooling standard.
* How decisions are made, and who makes them, in the community.
* New standalone standards.
* Decide on reference implementations for the standards.

This RFC process is not intended to be used for day-to-day decisions. As it is
intentionally too "heavy" for such use. And such decisions usually do not need
input from the wider community. Examples of such not-impactful decisions:

* Editorial changes to the standards, like section organization, grammar, and
  spelling.
* Details of reference implementations. I.e. how something is implemented is not
  important as long as the standards are followed.

[#design]
== Design

The sections below are duplicated in the appropriate location of the root
`README.adoc`. Which is included as part of this RFC.

[#process]
== Process

In order to add or make changes to the EcoStd standards one must get an RFC
approved (i.e. proposed, discussed, voted on, and merged). Before following the
steps below, make sure to read this entire process. As there are considerations
to keep in mind that will improve the chances of your proposal being effective.
The steps to submit an RFC are:

. Fork the https://github.com/ecostd/rfcs[RFCs repository].

. Copy the `src/00/00-template-adoc` (or `src/00/00-template-md` for
  Markdown/GFM) directory to `src/00/00-my-proposal` (change `my-proposal` to
  something short, but descriptive).

. Write your RFC in the `proposal.adoc` (or `proposal.md` for markdown/GFM)
  file. If you need additional files you should place them *only* in the 
  directory. It's important, i.e. required, to properly fill in the `authors` 
  and `email` metadata fields at the top with your information. As they are 
  used for proper license attribution. Consult the
  https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[Asciidoctor documentation],
  or on how to do that.

. Submit a pull request. In addition to the RFC itself you should provide a
  brief description in the pull request itself. Copy-pasting the RFC abstract
  into the PR description is minimally sufficient.

. Use the pull request number you now have to rename the
  `src/00/00-my-proposal` directory to match the PR number and fill the
  `rfcpr` field in `proposal.adoc` (or `proposal.md` for Markdown/GFM) to match.

. At this time the RFC will be considered _active_ and will be labeled
  accordingly. The RFC will receive initial feedback for which you will need to
  respond, preferably both in the PR comments and reflected in the RFC text
  itself.

. After some time, and sufficient discussion and interest, and if this is a
  proposal for a standard change (or addition) you wil need to write wording for
  the standard and create a PR in the
  https://github.com/ecostd/standard[standard] repository. You may also be
  directly asked to produce a wording PR if needed. When you have such a PR
  edit the RFC `:stdpr:` field. The RFC will be labeled either as needing
  wording and/or having wording as appropriate. The wording PR will be
  discussed in that PR and/or the RFC. The discussion may incur doing changes
  to the RFC.

. After sufficient time and discussion the combined RFC and wording PR will
  be considered ready for a decision on further progress. A member of the
  "adoption review group" will propose taking a vote for adoption.

. An adoption vote starts after three members of the review group agree. The
  vote will last at most 28 calendar days, and at least 7 calendar days. The
  length of the voting period will be part of the voting proposal. But the
  length is subject to community feedback before and during the voting. The
  RFC PR will be labeled accordingly to reflect the voting.

. When the adoption vote completes the RFC is either approved or rejected. The
  RFC will be labeled accordingly and may be closed.

. A rejected RFC PR may be closed depending on the reasons for rejection. The
  RFC may stay active, but go back to being discussed, if there are changes
  possible and reconsidered for approval.

. An approved RFC PR is closed, and labeled as adopted. The actions proscribed
  in the RFC are then taken up by others to complete. For RFCs that affect the
  https://github.com/ecostd/standard[standard] will continue in the related
  PR by the "standard editors group".

TIP: The preferred document format for RFCs is
https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]. But the
https://github.github.com/gfm/[GitHub Flavored Markdown] format is supported as
an alternative. The extent of support is subject to what is supported by the
conversion to Asciidoctor process.

[#prior-art]
== Prior Art

This proposal is roughly based on the
https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs[Rust Language RFC process] (as of 2024-12).
The Rust RFC process provides a compelling demonstration of the ability to
agree on changes to the Rust language in an open manner.

[#considerations]
== Considerations

Who makes up the "adoption review group"?::
The precise make up of who gets to vote on what RFCs get adopted is undecided.
Although it's likely that we will try and balance community involvement and the
RFC consumers (aka the tool implementors). Ideas, and volunteers, on this are
encouraged to comment.

How long should the adoption voting period be?::
There are many answers to this that are possible. Instead of choosing a specific
period for everything we use a variable range. This allows for faster turnaround
for smaller/easier RFCs. While allowing longer consideration for larger/harder
RFCs.

Should RFCs for new standards components require an implementation?::
While it would be desirable to have standards that mirror what is already out
in the wild, that is not always possible. Especially in the case where there
are multiple differing implementations for equivalent functionality. Hence it's
best to generally prefer implementation experience but to not require it.
