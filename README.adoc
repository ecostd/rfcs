[#process]
== Process

In order to add or make changes to the EcoStd standards one must get an RFC
approved (i.e. proposed, discussed, voted on, and merged). Before following the
steps below, make sure to read this entire process. As there are considerations
to keep in mind that will improve the chances of your proposal being effective.
The steps to submit an RFC are:

. Fork the https://github.com/ecostd/rfcs[RFCs repository].

. Copy the `src/00/00-template-adoc` (or `src/00/00-template-md` for
  Markdown/GFM) directory to `src/00/00-my-proposal` (change `my-proposal` to
  something short, but descriptive).

. Write your RFC in the `proposal.adoc` (or `proposal.md` for markdown/GFM)
  file. If you need additional files you should place them *only* in the 
  directory. It's important, i.e. required, to properly fill in the `authors` 
  and `email` metadata fields at the top with your information. As they are 
  used for proper license attribution. Consult the
  https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[Asciidoctor documentation],
  or on how to do that.

. Submit a pull request. In addition to the RFC itself you should provide a
  brief description in the pull request itself. Copy-pasting the RFC abstract
  into the PR description is minimally sufficient.

. Use the pull request number you now have to rename the
  `src/00/00-my-proposal` directory to match the PR number and fill the
  `rfcpr` field in `proposal.adoc` (or `proposal.md` for Markdown/GFM) to match.

. At this time the RFC will be considered _active_ and will be labeled
  accordingly. The RFC will receive initial feedback for which you will need to
  respond, preferably both in the PR comments and reflected in the RFC text
  itself.

. After some time, and sufficient discussion and interest, and if this is a
  proposal for a standard change (or addition) you wil need to write wording for
  the standard and create a PR in the
  https://github.com/ecostd/standard[standard] repository. You may also be
  directly asked to produce a wording PR if needed. When you have such a PR
  edit the RFC `stdpr` field. The RFC will be labeled either as needing
  wording and/or having wording as appropriate. The wording PR will be
  discussed in that PR and/or the RFC. The discussion may incur doing changes
  to the RFC.

. After sufficient time and discussion the combined RFC and wording PR will
  be considered ready for a decision on further progress. A member of the
  "adoption review group" will propose taking a vote for adoption.

. An adoption vote starts after three members of the review group agree. The
  vote will last at most 28 calendar days, and at least 7 calendar days. The
  length of the voting period will be part of the voting proposal. But the
  length is subject to community feedback before and during the voting. The
  RFC PR will be labeled accordingly to reflect the voting.

. When the adoption vote completes the RFC is either approved or rejected. The
  RFC will be labeled accordingly and may be closed.

. A rejected RFC PR may be closed depending on the reasons for rejection. The
  RFC may stay active, but go back to being discussed, if there are changes
  possible and reconsidered for approval.

. An approved RFC PR is closed, and labeled as adopted. The actions proscribed
  in the RFC are then taken up by others to complete. For RFCs that affect the
  https://github.com/ecostd/standard[standard] will continue in the related
  PR by the "standard editors group".

TIP: The preferred document format for RFCs is
https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]. But the
https://github.github.com/gfm/[GitHub Flavored Markdown] format is supported as
an alternative. The extent of support is subject to what is supported by the
conversion to Asciidoctor process as part of build the HTML for the
https://ecostd.github.io/rfcs/[RFCs website].

[#guidelines]
== Guidelines

These are a loose collection of rules to follow, things to keep in mind, and
background information that is useful when creating RFCs. They are grouped by
the aspect of RFCs that they apply to:

Mechanics:: Guidelines for the task of the RFC and PR itself.
Design:: Guidelines for that help with the design content of an RFC.

=== Mechanics

Do not squash, or otherwise coalesce, changes for RFC PRs::
After creating an RFC PR additional updates should be done as additional, plain,
commits. Having the additional commits helps in tracking how feedback is
addressed. When an RFC is approved it will be squash merged. Hence attempts to
pre-squash would be wasted.

Mirror external feedback in the PR::
Any feedback you get outside of PR comments should be summarized, by you, as
comments in the PR. And if there are changes, i.e. additional commits, to the
RFC that are related they should be mentioned in the PR comments.

Do not change approved PRs::
After a PR is approved, and labeled as such, do not alter it. It will be merged
in due time. If there are followup changes they should come as different RFCs.

=== Design

Prefer solutions that cast a wide net::
...

Including existing practice is essential for an RFC::
